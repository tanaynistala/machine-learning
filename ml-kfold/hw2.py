"""
A coding assignment that combines splitting data into train, test, and validation sets using scikit-learn (sklearn):

Problem Statement:

You are given a dataset containing information about different types of iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width,
petal length, and petal width). Your task is to build a machine learning model to classify the iris flowers into
three different classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their physical characteristics.

You are to do the following:
Step 1: Load the iris dataset
    Use the following code to load the iris dataset into a pandas dataframe:

Step 2: Split the data into training, validation, and test sets
    Use the following code to split the data into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets:

Step 3: Train a classifier (this function is provided for you)
    Use the following code to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the training set:

Step 4: Evaluate the model on the validation set
    Use the following code to evaluate the performance of the trained classifier on the validation set:
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

Step 5: Evaluate the model on the test set
    Use the following code to evaluate the performance of the trained classifier on the test set:

This assignment is designed to help you understand the basics of splitting data into train, validation, and test sets,
as well as training a simple machine learning model using scikit-learn. The assignment can be extended by trying
different classifiers, tuning the parameters, or exploring the dataset further.

Step 6: Then, do the same for K-Fold cross validation.
