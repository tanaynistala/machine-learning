# Machine Learning

A collection of introductory projects into artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, undertaken from Fall 2022 to Spring 2023. Projects here are prepended with one of the following codes:

* `ai`: simpler concepts as an introduction to topics in the field of artificial intelligence.
* `ml`: deep dives into various architectures and methods used in machine learning applications.
* `dl`: specific implementations of neural networks, like convolutional and transformer models.

These led to larger projects focusing on various deep learning architectures; you can find them on my profile page.
