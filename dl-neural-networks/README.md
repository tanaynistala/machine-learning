# Comp137 DNN: Assiginment 2

In this assignment, you will implement a feedforward neural network and apply it to two learning problems: a regression problem and a classification problem.

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to gain experience of training neural networks and further advance your understanding of PyTorch. By implementing a dense layer and a feedforward model, you will get a sense how PyTorch build its learning models.

## Instructions

You need to first install `torchvision` into the cs137 environment and then run the notebook `feedforward.ipynb` and follow instructions inside.

To support the notebook, you will need to implement two classes and one function in `implementation.py`. After you finish all tasks correctly, you need to
save the notebook as `feedforward.pdf`.

## Grading

Detailed grading rules are inside the notebook. Finally, you need to submit:
* your code files;
* two trained models.
* a pdf print of your notebook in the last run before your submission

Please zip the folder `assignment2` into a zip file and submit it.

Your implementations of the two classes and your trained models will be graded by the autograder through GradeScope.

When we grade your code, we check your result notebook as well as your code. If your code cannot generate the result of a problem in your notebook file, you will get zero point for that problem.
