# Assignment 1: Getting to Know PyTorch

## Objective 

In this assignment, you will learn basic concepts of PyTorch: allocating a tensor, multiplying tensors, and summing up tensor entries. You will also use PyTorch to implement a linear regression model and train it with PyTorch SGD optimizer. After this assignment, you will have a basic understanding of PyTorch and know how to use PyTorch documentations.  

## Instructions 
You can either run the code at Google colab or your local machine. You need to set up the environment specified by `environment.yml`. You are strongly suggested to use `conda` to set up the environment from the `.yml` file directly. You also need to install the `torchviz` package through `pip install torchviz` after you have activated the environment. 

All instructions of this assignment is in the notebook `notebook.ipynb`. You will need to fix issues in the code, answer questions, and implement necessary functions in `implementation.py`. There are 7 questions with total 20 points. Please read instructions carefully.  

## Grading

There are 7 questions with total 20 points. You will need to submit your work to GraphScope. In particular, you need to submit:
* 1) a zip file that zips this folder (please finish all your work in files we have provided and do NOT change file names or the directory structure; otherwise your code may not pass autograder). 
* 2) a pdf file that saves the nodebook output. 

When we grade your code, we check your result in the pdf file as well as your code. If your code cannot generate results in your pdf file, you will get zero point for that particular problem. Your code in `implementation.py` will be auto-graded through GradeScope. 


## Deadline

The deadline of this assignment is 11:59pm, Sep. 26, 2022. Please remember the policy of late submissions. You have three tokens for three late days for all work in this course. If you have no tokens to use or do not use a token, then the grade of a late submission within 24 hours of the deadline is discounted by 50%. A submission even later gets zero point.  

Please post your questions to piazza if you have any.
